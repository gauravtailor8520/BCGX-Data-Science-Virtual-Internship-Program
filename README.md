# BCG x Data Scientist Intern - PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis

## Task Overview üìä
This repository contains the tasks completed as part of the BCG x Data Scientist Internship, focused on analyzing customer churn for PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility company. The tasks cover Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering & Modeling, and Findings & Recommendations.

### Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing üìà
- **Objective**: To interpret PowerCo's concern about losing customers and to break down the problem before starting data analysis.
- **Key Learnings**: Understanding business context, problem deconstruction, client data requirement identification, and analysis techniques outlining.
- **Deliverable**: Email to Associate Director summarizing the approach.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis üìä
- **Objective**: Investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor leading to customer churn.
- **Key Learnings**: Techniques for conducting exploratory data analysis using Python, interpreting key trends from visualization.
- **Deliverable**: Jupyter notebook showcasing data analysis and visualization insights.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modeling üõ†Ô∏è
- **Objective**: Build new features to analyze data for predicting customer churn.
- **Key Learnings**: Understanding and implementing feature engineering techniques to enrich the datasets for predictive modeling.
- **Deliverable**: Python file containing the creation of new features for analysis.

### Task 4: Findings & Recommendations üìë
- **Objective**: Develop a predictive model to indicate churn risk and communicate insights with clients.
- **Key Learnings**: Building a predictive model using a random forest technique, evaluating the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
- **Deliverable**: Executive summary with findings for presentation at a steering committee meeting.

## Additional Information ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Each task's deliverable is included in the respective folder within this repository. The tasks provide valuable hands-on experience in data analysis, predictive modeling, and communication of insights for real-world business challenges.

I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding the data science processes and methodologies used to address customer churn issues for PowerCo.
